/// A ThreadPool allows efficient use of multi-core CPU machines by managing a collection of threads.
///
/// From first-principles, a (CPU) compute-bound application will run at peak performance when overheads
/// are minimized. Once enough parallelism is exposed to leverage all cores, one of the key overheads to
/// minmiize is context switching, and thead creation & destruction. The optimal system configuration is
/// thus a fixed-size threadpool where there is exactly one thread per CPU core (or rather, hyperthread).
/// This configuration results in zero context switching, no additional kernel calls for thread creation &
/// deletion, and full utilization of the hardware.
///
/// Unfortunately, in practice, it is infeasible to statically schedule work apriori onto a fixed pool of threads.
/// Even when applying the same operation to a homogenous dataset, there will inevitably be variability in
/// execution time. (This can arise from I/O interrupts taking over a core [briefly], or page faults, or even
/// different latencies for memory access across NUMA domains.) As a result, it is important for peak
/// performance to build abstractions that are flexible and dynamic in their work allocation.
///
/// The ThreadPool protocol is a foundational API designed to enable efficient use of hardware resources.
/// There are two APIs exposed to support two kinds of parallelism. For additional details, please see the
/// documentation associated with each.
///
/// Note: while there should be only one "physical" threadpool process-wide, there can be many virtual
/// threadpools that compose on top of this one to allow configuration and tuning. (This is why
/// `ThreadPool` is a protocol and not static methods.) Examples of additional threadpool abstractions
/// could include a separate threadpool per-NUMA domain, to support different priorities for tasks, or
/// higher-level parallelism primitives such as "wait-groups".
public protocol ThreadPool {
    /// Submit a task to be executed on the threadpool.

    /// Fork-join parallelism allows for efficient work-stealing parallelism. The two non-escaping
    /// functions will have finished executing before `pJoin` returns. The first function will execute on
